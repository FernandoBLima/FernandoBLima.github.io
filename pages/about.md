Hello there! Welcome to my personal blog!

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3ornk57KwDXf81rjWM/giphy.gif" /></div>
<br>


Well, I'm a computer engineer living in Recife and during my time at university I discovered that I'm passionate about programming. I had the opportunity to work with software development for different environments and languages using agile project management. In addition, I am fascinated by challenges and new experiences and enthusiast in machine learning, data mining and new technologies. 

So, the main reason for the existence of this blog is that it offers me a space to write down and share the things I'm searching and learning. 

<!-- Besides that what I can say about me is that I'm crazy about movies! Especially during the Oscar period, when I try to watch all the nominees. I also love read book, playing video games and board games like Carcassone, Splendor and Jaipur. -->

Stay out of trouble and see you all around!

Long live and prosper!
